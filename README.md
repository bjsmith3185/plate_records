This App could assist a LEO during a traffic stop investigation.

The user can enter vehicle tag information and view 1) vehicle information 2) any previous vehicle stops and interaction with a LEO.

Previously a LEO only had access to the drivers official history record ( a conviction on their driving record ). There was no record of each time the vehicle was stopped and issued a warning or if the citation was dropped in court. 

This app will allow the LEO to view detailed information for each time a vehicle was investigated regardless if a previous charge is or is not on their record. A vehicle tag search will return the following information:

Vehicle:
    - Tag
    - State
    - Vehicle Make
    - Vehicle Model
    - Vehicle Year
    - Vehicle Color
    - Owner
    - Owner Address
    - Previous encounters with a LEO
        - Driver during the encounter
        - Date of encounter
        - Location (Street, City, State)
        - Reason for the encounter
        - Result of the encounter (Warning, Citation)
        - Noted from the LEO about the encounter

The app requires the user to login to make search request and to add a vehicle encounter. The purpose of this app is to provide additional information in order to keep citizens safe.
