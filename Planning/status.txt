    just added the post and put routes for the Records collection.

    I am using a const {} to add the data to the collection because there is no front end.

    The _id's are hard coded in right now so it must be changed to perform the update (put) request.

    Rewired:
        removed the records collection (it would be too big with state and tags)
        replace with a collection for each state ( just nc and sc for now)
        each state collection containg vehicle tags

    Working;
        * Adding new tag to the state collection
        * Adding an encounter _id to a state collection ( offier notes related to a specific tag)
        * Search by state/tag: focuses the tag search on the specified state collection

    TODO:
        * If the state/tag search is empty
            - error to user: is the correct state entered?
                * Retry search with new state data
                
            - Can I search each state database for the tag? (maybe by a prompt from user)

        * Validation for data entered by officer (encounters route)
