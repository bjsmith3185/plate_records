Server Logic

    User performs a search 
        - enter tag, state 
        - search DB collection Records with the search query(tag, state)
                - update the DB collection Searches with the previous search query
        - return the results from the search to client 

    User enters data 
        - inputs available
            * Default populate from records collection = tag, state, vehicle, owner, address
            * User Input = date, driver, location, rs, result, encounterInfo
            * Default populate from users collection = officer.name, officer.org, officer.code

Maybe use jwt for token auth?
